# Fashion-MNIST AI Classifier 

This project is a deep learning model trained on the **[Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)** to classify images of clothing into categories such as shirts, shoes, and bags.  

The model was built in **Python** using libraries such as **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, leveraging their powerful tools for neural network design and training.

# Features
- Uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset (70,000 grayscale images, 28x28 pixels each).
- Implements a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Trains on clothing categories such as:
  - T-shirts/tops
  - Trousers
  - Pullovers
  - Dresses
  - Coats
  - Sandals
  - Shirts
  - Sneakers
  - Bags
  - Ankle boots
